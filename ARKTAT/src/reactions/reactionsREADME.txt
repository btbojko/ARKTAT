The reaction classes setup the algorithm to determine
reaction source terms at constant energy and mass over 
a specified amount of time. This utilizes the kinetic rates,
the eos, and the ODE solver to determine the reaction
source terms that will subsequently be passed off to another
programm to advance the Navier-Stokes equations with chemical
reactions.
