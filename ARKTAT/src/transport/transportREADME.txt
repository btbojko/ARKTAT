Transport classses are meant to calculate the neccessary
coefficients that define the transport of mass, momentum, 
and energy of a material. This will typically be the diffusivity,
vicosity, and thermal conductivity. Initially everything will
be determined using a Sutherland model, but more advanced models
can be implemented in the future.
