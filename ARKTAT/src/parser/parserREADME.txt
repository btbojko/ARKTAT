The parser classes are meant to read in the standard forms
of the thermodynamic, transport, and kinetic variables that are
needed to analyze the thermo states, transport properites, and
reaction rates for the material. These will typically be in CHEMKIN
formatted files (typically 3 files), but will initially be in an XML 
formatted file that includes all necessary data. The parser will 
read this in and initialize the coefficients as needed.
