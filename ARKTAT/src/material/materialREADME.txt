The material set of classes are used to store the relevant information of the
gas, liquid, or solid. This would include the thermodynamic variables (T, P, 
rho, Yi, etc.), the transport properties (Pr, Sc, D, k, mu), the species list
used to define the mixture. This could potentially be used to access all relevant
quantities and could essentially be an interface used to determine the reaction rates,
thermodynamic, and transport porperties needed in a simulation.
